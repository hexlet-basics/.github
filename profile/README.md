# Code Basics

Code Basics is an open-source Hexlet side-project. Both the website source code and the entire content are open. Its goal is to give the basics of programming languages with practice right in the browser. All of the courses are free and will remain so forever. An English-language edition awaits completion eventually. It's already available but only partially translated.

We keep in mind two issues building our courses: the first language and the second language.

"The first language" is a learning path built for complete beginners in programming. PHP, JavaScript, Python, Java, Clang.

By "second language" we mean Racket, Haskell, Go, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, Clojure, TypeScript, Rust, Shell. You tend to learn these languages already knowing something else, so its curriculum differs from the first languages. 

We wrote PHP and JavaScript courses ourselves, yet we have already accepted dozens of pull requests on all sorts of issues: fixing typos, making mistakes in assignments, improving pitch, translating to English. The whole Python course was developed by a person from the community who became the maintainer of the language in our project. He has already accepted several pull requests.

Tasks:

* Improvement of current courses. A list of lessons and languages is available on GitHub.
* Website enhancements. Current tasks appear in "issues".
* Development of new language courses. Currently, we are working on Java and Ruby.
* English translation.
* Promotion of the project to the public =)
